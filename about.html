                Hi there! My name is Albert and I'm simply someone looking to learn new skills. My first venture into the world of computers came through an afterschool group I stumbled upon in the sixth grade, where students could program simple video games using Tynker, a block based programming language.
            <p>
                Since then, I've dabbled with Java where I created a (mediocre) computer player for Connect4 and a (very bad) chatbot for NBA fans, built a random assortment of Amazon Alexa voice skills, devised more simple games using Javaâ€™s greenfoot library, designed the first digital and standardized set of protocol forms for radiology orders, made this meretricious website, and had a brief phase in high school where I really got into business and finance for some random reason.
            <p>
                I'm looking for my next adventure, so please take a look at the <a class="about_me_links" href="/projects">projects section</a> to see what I've made, <a class="about_me_links" href="mailto:albert_su@berkeley.edu">shoot me an email</a> or send me a connection request on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-su/">linkedIn</a>. :)
